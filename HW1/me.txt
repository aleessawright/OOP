My name is Alyssa Wright. I am biomedical engineering major and 
minoring in Spanish and Computer Science. I am a junior currently. 
I am on the GT Club Gymnastics team, and I like to crochet. I have chosen to 
take the online asynchronous version of CS1331 because I heard the resources on Canvas
are good, and the class fits with my schedule better than the other versions.
